### Steps to Run the App

Open project in XCode, select connected device or simulator and press "Run" button.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

Main focus was on creating a clean structure that later could be easily extended. I wanted to create MVP product that has some minimal but complete functionality so I added detail view for source page and ability to play the recipe videos.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

It was basically way more than anticipated, but I had a little break from mobile development and had to dig around few things as it evolves quickly.
I think I spent around 15h all together.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

Definitely UI is a trade-off here - I was rather focusing on functionality and left UI pretty generic (I tried to make it clean and usable though)

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Answer for that is similar to trade-off - UI, it's generic and there is no tests (as per project requirements).

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?

I used CachedAsyncImage package to cache icon images and YoutubePlayerKit for playing recipe videos.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
